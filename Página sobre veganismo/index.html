                <h3>"Veganism is a philosophy <br> and way of living which seeks <br> to exclude—as far as is possible <br> and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, <br> and cruelty to, <br> animals for food, <br> clothing or any other purpose; <br> and by extension, <br> promotes the development <br> and use of animal-free alternatives for <br> the benefit of animals, <br> humans and the environment. <br> In dietary terms it denotes the practice <br> of dispensing <br> with all products derived <br> wholly or partly from animals."</h3>

                <p class="historia">Although the vegan diet <br> was defined early on in The Vegan Society's <br> beginnings in 1944, <br>by Donald Watson and our founding members.<br> It was as late as 1949 <br>before Leslie J Cross pointed out that the society lacked<br> a definition of veganism. <br>He suggested <br>“[t]he principle of the emancipation of animals from exploitation by man”.<br> This is later clarified as “to seek an end<br> to the use of animals by man for food,<br> commodities, work, hunting, vivisection,<br> and by all other uses involving exploitation of animal life by man”.</p>

                <p class="historia">The society was first registered <br>as a charity in August 1964<br> but its assets were later transferred to a new charity <br>when it also became a limited company in December 1979.<br> The definition of veganism <br>and the charitable objects of the society<br> were amended and refined over the years.<br> By winter 1988 the current definition was in use<br> - although the phrasing has changed slightly over the years.</p>

                the UN says meat and dairy (farmed livestock) accounts for 11.2% of manmade greenhouse gas emissions. But, if we all went vegan, scientists believe the world's food-related emissions might drop by 68% within 15 years, limiting global warming.

                    Animal agriculture takes a devastating <br> toll on the earth. It is an inefficient <br> way of producing food, since feed for farm animals requires <br> land, water, fertilizer, and other resources that could otherwise have been used directly <br> for producing human food.
                    <br>
                    Animal agriculture dependence on higher yields accelerates <br> topsoil erosion on our farmlands, <br> rendering land less productive for crop cultivation, and forcing the conversion of wilderness to grazing and farm lands. <br>
                    Animal waste from massive feedlots and factory farms <br> are a leading cause of pollution in our groundwater and rivers.

                    Eggs are higher in cholesterol than any other food, <br> making them a leading contributor to <br> cardiovascular disease. The American Dietetic <br> Association reports that vegetarian/vegan diets are <br> associated with reduced risks for all of these <br> conditions.</p>
