                <h3>"Veganism is a philosophy <br> and way of living which seeks <br> to exclude—as far as is possible <br> and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, <br> and cruelty to, <br> animals for food, <br> clothing or any other purpose; <br> and by extension, <br> promotes the development <br> and use of animal-free alternatives for <br> the benefit of animals, <br> humans and the environment. <br> In dietary terms it denotes the practice <br> of dispensing <br> with all products derived <br> wholly or partly from animals."</h3>

                <p class="pseção">Although the vegan diet <br> was defined early on in The Vegan Society's <br> beginnings in 1944, <br>by Donald Watson and our founding members.<br> It was as late as 1949 <br>before Leslie J Cross pointed out that the society lacked<br> a definition of veganism. <br>He suggested <br>“[t]he principle of the emancipation of animals from exploitation by man”.<br> This is later clarified as “to seek an end<br> to the use of animals by man for food,<br> commodities, work, hunting, vivisection,<br> and by all other uses involving exploitation of animal life by man”.</p>
                <p class="pseção">The society was first registered <br>as a charity in August 1964<br> but its assets were later transferred to a new charity <br>when it also became a limited company in December 1979.<br> The definition of veganism <br>and the charitable objects of the society<br> were amended and refined over the years.<br> By winter 1988 the current definition was in use<br> - although the phrasing has changed slightly over the years.</p>
